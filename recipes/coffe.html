    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Coffee brewed slowly in cold water is less acidic than hot brewed. You can use this concentrate straight over ice or microwave half a mug coffee
        and then add a half cup of boiling water for quick hot coffee. Develop your own ratio of coffee to water for your custom brew. </p>

        <li>4 ½ cups cold water </li>

        <li>coffee filters </li>
      </ul>

        <li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap and steep at room temperature for 18 to 24 hours</li>
        <li>Line a strainer with several layers of cheesecloth and place atop a pitcher; strain coffee through the cheesecloth into the pitcher.
